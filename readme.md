# Google Analytics simplified

Google Analytics simplified is a simple WordPress plugin for adding Google Analytics tracking to a WordPress based site.

When the Google Analytics property ID has been entered on the plugin option page (located under Settings). A snippet for Google Analytics will be added to the `wp_footer`-hook in WordPress. If your theme do not utilizes the `wp_footer`-hook the plugin will not work.

The plugin will add the site URL to the snippet, this way no other sites will be tracked. It also support preview-mode. Which means that when you're previewing a post, the snippet will not be displayed and your page views will not be tracked.
